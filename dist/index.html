  <h3>Summary</h2>
    <img src="http://qlip.in/avatar.png" />
<p>I have completed hundreds of projects on behalf of multinational clients and independent startups, working on every aspect of web development, from initial design through to final product. I'm highly skilled in key coding languages: HTML, CSS, SASS, PHP, Laravel PHP Framework, JQuery and MySQL.</p>

 <p>I’m also proficient in SEO and Photoshop, so not only can I design your dream website and make it come to life, I can give it a head start in terms of search engine rankings, too.</p>

<p>I'm also experienced in using Twitter's bootstrap plugin and grid system (CSS framework), and I know how to improve search engine rankings. I love everything about web development and enjoy creating innovative, user-friendly designs on Adobe PhotoShop, before bringing them to life on fully-customisable content management systems.</p>
    
<p>If you’re interested in harnessing my wealth of knowledge and skills, here are just some the services which I offer to clients.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
  <div class="columns" > 
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        <span class="skills">HTML 5:</span>
        HTML is the most important mark-up language when it comes to developing the front end of a website. I’m an expert in HTML 5, and have developed dozens of attractive and easy-to-use front ends for a variety of clients.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="skills">Wordpress:</span>
        WordPress is one of the most popular content management systems in the world. The New York Times, Sony and Forbes all use WordPress, a roll call testament to the intuitive, customisable nature of the platform. Join these huge companies in using WordPress today and hire me to create a fully responsive theme.
      </li>  
      <li>
        <span class="skills">Laravel:</span>
        Laravel is the PHP framework for developers who like a little breathing space. Let me show you what I can do with this wonderfully effective, but effortlessly simple, framework.
      </li>
       <li>
        <span class="skills">PHP:</span>
        PHP enhances the functions of a website, but my knowledge of this scripting language is more than just functional. I can create payment gateways and much more with PHP.
      </li>  
      <li>
        <span class="skills">MySQL:</span>
        MySQL is mainly used to create database driven applications. I use PHPMyAdmin and Sequel Pro to create large-scale applications and content management systems for clients.
      </li>  
      <li>
        <span class="skills">Search Engine Optimisation:</span>
        You can have the most beautiful website in the world, but if Google, Bing and the other search engine behemoths don’t like it, you’ll find your online presence sinking without a trace. I understand how search engines crawl websites, and always design sites with the spectre of SEO lurking at the front of my mind.
